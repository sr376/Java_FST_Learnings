Your log output shows that your Spring Boot JDBC application is working correctly. Here's a breakdown of what’s happening:

Application Startup

The application starts using Java 23.0.1.

No active profile is set, so it falls back to the default profile.

HikariCP (the connection pool) is initializing.

Database Connection

HikariCP starts and successfully adds a connection to an in-memory H2 database (jdbc:h2:mem:e6c4509a-82db-45bd-bc6a-eb2999725b8e).

Data Insert and Retrieval

The application adds a new Alien record:

bash
Copy
Edit
Added: Alien{id=111, name='srujan', tech='java'}
It retrieves and prints all the existing records:

bash
Copy
Edit
[Alien{id=101, name='vivek', tech='chain'}, 
 Alien{id=102, name='srujan', tech='java'}, 
 Alien{id=103, name='teja', tech='python'}, 
 Alien{id=111, name='srujan', tech='java'}]
Application Shutdown

HikariCP initiates and completes the shutdown.

Possible Checks
If the database is resetting after each run, check if you want a persistent database instead of H2 in-memory.

If you expect more records, ensure that the data source isn't being reset on application restart.

If unintended duplicates appear, verify that your insert logic doesn’t insert the same data multiple times.
